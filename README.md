# Hola !!!

I am Yuma a marine biologist diving the vast Coding Ocean, keep finding myself in bug-infested waters, tangled in the tentacles of errors, and scared of killer Java bytes.

I am working in the Molecular Ecology Lab at Flinders University (MELFU) with Prof Luciano Beheregaray. My main interest is the integration of molecular and ecological approaches to better understand evolutionary processes. I have been involved in molecular ecology research since 2000.

In my spare time,  I collaborate with the revegetation Morialta Biolink Landcare Group in revegetation projects to re-establish some Australian bushland to connect and restore the native ecosystems in the Adelaide Hills region. And when the weather allows I enjoy some skydiving.
